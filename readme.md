# Data Science Workshop  -  Introduction to Data Science in [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/)

This introductory workshop provides training in data mining with the [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) environment. Examples presented in the workshop will focus on applications in natural and life sciences. [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) is a quickly developing tool for data analysis, embraced both by academia and industry (Google, Microsoft or Facebook). This workshop will introduce attendees to key concepts of data science and give a hands-on experience without requiring a previous knowledge of [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/).


The workshop is part of the two conferences:

  * [International Biotech Innovation Days](https://www.healthcapital.de/en/events/event/ibid-2020-international-biotech-innovation-days/), which will take place from the 27 - 29 October 2020 remotly at the [Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) Cottbus – Senftenberg](https://www.b-tu.de/en/) (Campus Senftenberg) and
  * the [WhyR annual meeting of Polish R community](https://2020.whyr.pl/). 

The workshop will cover fundamental topics including:

- getting to know [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) packages and R-related tools for data science
- data manipulation (import of data, summarizing and transforming large volumes of data),
- data visualization (graphical exploratory analysis, visualization of predictive models).

Exercises from this workshop employ data from life sciences, with a special focus on biomedical sciences and bioinformatics. Despite that fact, skills mastered during this event can be easily transferred to other applications. 


## Target audience:

The course is tailored for attendees with little to no experience with [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/). Any programming experience is welcomed, but not required to participate in the workshop. Topics touched during the workshop stuits equally needs of participants from industry and research.

## Requirements:

To participate in this course you are required to bring your own laptop, with a recent version of [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) ([http://cran.us.r-project.org/](http://cran.us.r-project.org/)) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) ([https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). To install necessary packages and download data run in [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) the following script:

## Instructors:

[Michał Burdukiewicz](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michal_Burdukiewicz) is a bioinformatician at Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics Polish Academy of Sciences with 13 years of experience with R. He is working on machine learning models for prediction of protein properties. He is passionate about open-source scientific software, Michał established Wrocław [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) User Group and organizes Why R?  conferences. Michał is author of several research papers, [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) software packages and R-based web-server applications.

[Dominik Rafacz](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dominik_Rafacz2) is a student at Warsaw University of Technology at field of Data Science. [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/), Java and C++ developer, interested especially in designing efficient tools and refining existing ones. He loves to write clean software with attention to comfort of use and maintenance. He takes his first steps in bioinformatics. Hobbistically interested in board games, both in terms of recreation and in terms of strategy analysis and optimization.
